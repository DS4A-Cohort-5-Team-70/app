## Initial steps
Make sure you have `Python` installed, you can check its version with the following command in your terminal.
```bash
python3 --version
```
*If it does not work, replace python3 with python.*

The version might be greater than `Python 3.8.0` in order to ensure full compatibility.

## How to run the code locally?

Clone this repository, open a terminal where the code is stored and run the following command.

```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
*If it does not work, replace pip3 with pip.*

```bash
python3 index.py
```
*If it does not work, replace python3 with python.*

And once compiled go to your `localhost` and `port` specified in the output of the terminal.
